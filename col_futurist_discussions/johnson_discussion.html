                                    Below is Brian Johnson's keynote presentation at Compute Midwest. In his
                                    presentation titled "The Future of Technology", Brian Johnson goes into what
                                    futurology is, the different subfields that exist in this study, and what it is
                                    futurists do.

                                <p>
                                    To start off his presentation, Johnson introduces himself as both a principle
                                    engineer and futurist. This means that his job entails both projecting and modeling
                                    what what it would be like living as a human with technology 10 to 15 years into
                                    the future, and to model the specs that new chipsets would need to measure up to. He
                                    goes on to saying that to develop future technologies, these technologies first
                                    need to be conceptualized, as "nothing great was ever built by human beings that was
                                    not imagined first". But trying to construct an image of the future from schemas
                                    that have been constructed from movies and advertisements, we see images such as:
                                </p>
                                <center><img class="pt10 pb10" src="../images/future_depiction.JPG" alt="future1"></center>
                                <p>
                                    But Johnson sees a problem with this depiction. He asks questions such as "Where are
                                    the baby toys? Where are the pillows? Where are the family photos?" He asks these to
                                    raise a point on human diversity in beliefs and cultures, to show that depictions of
                                    future technologies devoids humans of what makes them intrinsically human.
                                </p>
                                <center><img class="pt10 pb10" src="../images/future_depiction2.JPG" alt="future2"></center>
                                <p>
                                    This, he says, is a more accurate projection of what humans using future technology
                                    is going to look like. Comparing the two depictions, Johnson says that the second,
                                    more accurate depiction is more comfortable and that is ultimately the goal of
                                    technology, "to fit beautifully into people's lives".
                                    <br><br>
                                    Johnson's projection of the future of technology falls very much in line with what
                                    other futurists believe. That is, he believes that technologies, when conceived, are
                                    designed to satisfy some niche that is efficiency and convenience. This is realized
                                    by understanding in which area (economy, finance, medicine, etc.) this technology
                                    is to be used for, to make more convenient and resource efficient a pre-existing
                                    technology in that area, and to make it simpler.
                                    <br><br>
                                    There is a key moment in his speech where Johnson talks about big data technologies,
                                    which are technologies in which very large amounts of data are exchanged and
                                    modified using complex algorithms talking to other systems with their own complex
                                    algorithms. At this moment, Johnson essentially sums up the overarching argument his
                                    speech is attempting to make by reminding the audience that technologies can do a
                                    lot of things such as making us "more healthy, happier, more productive, and more
                                    efficient, all that stuff, [but] in this age of big data and in this secret life of
                                    data, you always have to remember that all of this data all of intelligence is
                                    meaningless until it comes back and touches the lives of people".
