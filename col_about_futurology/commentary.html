                                    Futurology is the projection of the future based on past and recent trends. It can cover
                                    a wide variety of fields from politics, to history, to science. In other words,
                                    futurology is defined as "the study of the future". In the narrowed focus of the
                                    sciences and technologies, futurology, as depicted by popular media and fiction will
                                    likely leave many people either disappointed or fearful of what's to come. For instance,
                                    Hollywood has done a good job of scaring the pants off the general population by
                                    showcasing future technologies in a more apocalyptic light through machine intelligence
                                    such as Hal9000 from the Space Odyssey and robots from the Terminator. But actual trends
                                    of technological development have shown to be very different from this.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Futurists such as Rachel Armstrong and Brian Johnson claim that technologies, when
                                    conceived, are designed to satisfy problems of efficiency and/or impossibility. This is
                                    in large part because humans have progressed by thinking and expecting in a linear
                                    fashion. We are accustomed to a linear, well-behaved world in which we usually deal with
                                    no more than seven variables at any one time. But as interactions in the world become
                                    faster and complex ecosystems such as national banking systems grow far too complex
                                    beyond human understanding, we find our reliance and symbiosis with technology to be
                                    more apparent. Regarding technologies with an efficiency-oriented goal, issues of
                                    efficiency often result from an excess of time and resource inputs, high learning
                                    curves, or effort needed to satisfy complex tasks. For instance, a current technology
                                    that is constantly evolving today, 3D printing, aims to produce efficiency in
                                    manufacturing by reducing the above criteria. Its usage today is highly versatile to the
                                    manufacturing of parts and goods, making even the construction of large things such as
                                    housing complexes cheaper in resource and worker resources by reducing waste and thus,
                                    general inputs. Although the positive upsides are easily apparent, the repercussions in
                                    economy have dependencies on the supply and demand for these resources.

                                    Similarly, as a result of the growing complexity of current systems, it has become
                                    impossible to understand, and thus work with, such systems without much assistance from
                                    robot intelligence. Futurist Peter Cochrane has shown artificial intelligence, or AI,
                                    are now involved in the design of things like oil rigs, refineries, and the wiring
                                    systems of electronics and aircrafts that have become much too complex for humans to
                                    comprehend. Even in creativity, in a survey conducted by Scientific American in 2001,
                                    AI have recreated old, patented inventions that eclipsed the performances of its older
                                    counterparts. Even in new technologies, such as planetary rovers and futuristic
                                    antennas, the designs go beyond humans' current capabilities for design, thus creating
                                    our fear of being usurped in creative capacities.

                                    current and up-and-coming technologies. By showcasing potential developments of future
                                    sciences and technologies in various fields, the website hopes to provide an
                                    understanding of how technologies are to grow and to invoke thoughts on what these
                                    technologies affect in the environments (possibly encompassing social and economic
                                    factors) in which they are introduced.
