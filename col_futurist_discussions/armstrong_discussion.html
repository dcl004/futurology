                                Below is Rachel Armstron's keynote presentation at Pera Technology. In her speech
                                titled, "Our 21st Century Future: Carbon Capture Architecture & Other Design Fictions",
                                she projects future technologies with a primary focus on ecological technologies.
                                Armstrong provides an explanation on what the future is in a wide context by exploring
                                how the idea of the future is changing from a 20th century paradigm to a 21st century
                                one, and by examining what kind of opportunities and challenges these shifts result in.
                                And how approaches to thinking about the future may be harnessed through an applied
                                practice known as Design Fiction.

                                In the past century of human existence, 'the future' has been in a 'beta' phase of
                                development, where many 'futuristic' products and inventions have been imagined in a
                                science fiction context, but has never been realized to commercial circulation.
                                Armstrong talks of how human lives are increasingly tied to commercial production and
                                product consumption. We are devouring our world in an act that can be described as
                                "stealing the future, selling it in the present, and calling it GDP".
                                <br><br>
                                20th century views on science adopts a view of the world that is familiar to us by
                                pre-existing notions and ideas on science and mathematics. Thus, when aeroplanes and
                                automobiles started coming into production, people were not so surprised, as it was
                                logically predicted earlier on that someday we would have flying cars. The problem with
                                awaiting, creating, and experiencing these technologies after having imagined them is
                                that we have realized that they have not drastically changed the way we live. 20th
                                century consumerism has led us to desire our fetishized products as fast as we
                                conceptualize them. Armstrong states that our future is becoming "productized" and
                                constantly changing; thus, if we were to make predictions so far from the present, the
                                more likely we are to be wrong on the outcome.
                                <br><br>
                                Many imagined conceptualizations for technologies have been realized or have failed to
                                come about. But the biggest invention, that was largely unseen, unlike many of the
                                other past ideas, was the internet. The notion of linking many computers together as
                                such was not anticipated in a culture that was so entrenched in the idea of 'itemized'
                                products. Thus, we see that the most disruptive and unseen technologies 'always' comes
                                from startups and innovative, unanticipated ideas, which is what 21st century views
                                encompasses.
                                <br><br>
                                21st century scientific views deals with networks and flows rather than the individual
                                elements or products that 20th century scientific views focuses on. This empowers us
                                with the creative freedom to shape events as we encounter them, although it results in
                                an unevenly distributed future since areas are changed as a result of conditions of
                                events.
                                <br><br>
                                Armstrong argues that old views (referring to 20th century scientific views), where
                                approaches are much more 'laboratory controlled' are insufficient in the coming ages of
                                technological growth. It is through <b>Synergy</b> - "the convergence of multiple
                                disciplines", <b>Synthesis</b> - "when different disciplines collaborate alongside each
                                other to produce something new", and <b>Speculation</b> - "which enables us to inhabit
                                unexplored spaces", that make up Design Fiction, that we may "get to a point of
                                realization where we understand that the future did not 'go' anywhere [but rather],
                                evolved."
